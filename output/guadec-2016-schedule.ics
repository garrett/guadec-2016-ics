DESCRIPTION:Flow graphs are awesome. Like no other widget\, they feel intui
 tive and are straightforward to use.\n\nIn this talk\, you will be taken on
  a short tour that shows you where to find flow graphs in common Free softw
 are.\n\nThen\, we will look at libgtkflow\, a library built upon the GNOME 
 stack that makes it easy for you to use flow graphs in your own Gtk-based a
 pplications.\n\nAfter this we will discuss the future use of flow graphs in
  GNOME-related software.

DESCRIPTION:Major Linux distributions have a problem with WebKit security. 
 Whereas major desktop browsers push automatic security updates directly to 
 users on a regular basis so that users donât have to worry about updates\
 , Linux users are dependent on their distributions to release updates. Well
  over 100 vulnerabilities that could allow remote code execution were fixed
  in WebKit last year\, so getting updates out to users is critical. This ta
 lk examines the disconnect between how the WebKit project handles security 
 issues upstream and how different major distributions do (or do not) handle
  security issues\, shows that WebKit security issues have widespread impact
  even for users who do not use a WebKit-based web browser\, and discusses t
 he security consequences of the split between the original WebKit API and W
 ebKit2.

DESCRIPTION:Structured logging is a handy feature of modern log systems\, l
 ike journald. GLib is growing functionality to allow applications to export
  log messages in structured form\, which allows developers and sysadmins to
  more easily search and sort log messages to find what they're looking for.
 \n\nThis talk will introduce the new APIs and give an overview of how appli
 cations and libraries should log in the new world order.

DESCRIPTION:GNOME Software is an project that started life as an applicatio
 n installer\, and over time picked up features such as updating system firm
 ware\, distribution upgrades\, installation of fonts\, codecs\, language pa
 cks\, and handling RPM files and Flatpak bundles. With screenshots\, long d
 escriptions and now user-submitted ratings and reviews we're on parity with
  several other appstores like the Google play store and provide a fast\, st
 able and beautiful software center for Fedora. In this talk I will explain 
 about how we built this beast\, show off some new features and also talk ab
 out the future. I'll allow lots of time for questions and comments.\n\nNote

DESCRIPTION:Despite what tablet- and phone-loving pundits say\, the laptop 
 is here to stay. When a user wants to watch a movie on a train\, they reach
  for the tablet first. But if they want to do actual\, real work\, they sti
 ll prefer the laptop.\n\nMeanwhile\, software freedom should always be for 
 everyone\, not just technical users and software developers. The GNOME proj
 ect was one of the first in this history of Free Software to realize this\,
  and seek to create a free software desktop that truly allowed everyone to 
 enjoy the software freedom that those of us had already happily found with 
 Bash and Emacs (or vi :) years before.\n\nThis keynote will discuss why GNO
 ME remains best poised to deliver software freedom to everyone\, how GNOME 
 continues to be the best welcome-mat for those who want software freedom\, 
 and why GNOME remains absolutely essential to the advancement of software f
 reedom for decades to come.

DESCRIPTION:GNOME provides a complete free software desktop. If you run it 
 yourself you have all the benefits of free software\, the freedoms to use\,
  study\, share\, and improve the software. You are in control of what you d
 o with your computer.\n\nThe situation is different when using software whi
 ch is run by others as a service\, even if these others run free software. 
 There you don't have control about what software is run and how. What does 
 that mean for your freedoms? How much control do you still have? Do you kno
 w what is happening to your data? Do you have the freedom to switch to a di
 fferent service? How is your own freedom affecting the freedom of other use
 rs of the same service? There are a lot of questions like these.\n\nThere a
 re a couple of approaches how to address these questions. There are the use
 r data manifesto [1]\, the "Terms of Service\; Didn't Read" site [2]\, the 
 GNU ethical repository criteria [3]\, and other attempts at covering specif
 ic aspects of freedom of web services. But there is no definition yet what 
 makes a web service free as in freedom\, which is as concise and elegant as
  the free software definition is.\n\nThis presentation will give an overvie
 w of where we are\, what approaches to defining the freedom of web services
  exist\, and what is missing. It's intended to start a discussion which lea
 ds to a definition of what a web service has to provide to give users the s
 ame freedom as they have when running free software themselves. This is the
  beginning of a journey and everybody who cares about freedom is invited to
  join.\n\n[1]: https://userdatamanifesto.org/\n[2]: https://tosdr.org/\n[3]

DESCRIPTION:The process of translate strings into different languages is kn
 own as "localization". \nThis is because it is part of the software develop
 ment lifecycle\, and it is the process of adapting the software into a spec

 low in Gnome\, Fedora and Openstack\, and also introduce latest technology 
 called 'Zanata' which can support successful localization environment for F
 edora and Openstack.

DESCRIPTION:There are around 285 million visually impaired people in the wo
 rld\, out of which around 38-39 million are completely blind. One interesti
 ng fact is that over 15 million of blind people are from India\, and simila
 rly a large number is from different developing or undeveloped countries\, 
 and poor socioeconomic status. There is a lot of software available for acc
 essibility\, and most of it is extremely unaccessible\, both economically a
 nd socially. This is where Free Software comes in. Free Software desktops\,
  especially GNOME\, have made large strides in accessibility in the last fe
 w years\, and are proving to be an effective way of reaching these people\,
  introducing them to a whole new world of computers. \n\nI'm going to talk 
 about how Free Software enables people to expand upon accessibility softwar
 e\, add regional languages\, and helps people in bad socioeconomic settings
 . I'll then proceed to show a 2-3 minute demo of how the universal access f
 eatures of GNOME work\, and what we need to improve.

DESCRIPTION:GTK is an old tool kit\; it turns 20 in 2007. While its history
  is a long\, unbroken chain of progress\, GTK is\, at its heart\, heavily b
 ased on how we used to do things in GUI tool kits two decades ago. Over the
  past 5 years\, since the 3.0 release\, the GTK team has been hard at work 
 into bringing the tool kit internals kicking and screaming into the XXI cen
 tury. This has inevitably caused some friction with application developers\
 , but it has also opened an entire world of possibilities.\n\nIn this talk 
 I'll outline where we are coming from\, what has changed\, where we're goin
 g in the future â and how we'll get there.

DESCRIPTION:... with the Meson build system on Linux\, and ~15x faster on W
 indows.\n\nLast year\, Jussi Pakkanen (the maintainer of Meson) gave a talk
  about improving the way GNOME apps are built by replacing Autotools with t
 he Meson build system.\n\nThis year\, I'll be talking about how we at Centr
 icular worked along exactly those lines and ported GStreamer\, GLib\, and i
 ts core dependencies from Autotools to Meson. Besides the improvements in s
 peed\, using Meson provided numerous advantages over Autotools such as clea
 ner syntax\, better cross-platform support\, maintainable code\, and much m
 ore.\n\nI will be talking about our porting journey and make the case that 
 Meson is indeed ready for replacing Autotools in every case we've seen so f
 ar. The next step is convincing more projects to try out Meson.

DESCRIPTION:Many people who know of GNOME are involved in IT related areas.
  For example\, they may be IT students\, work in R&D\, or be involved in a 
 startup.\n\nBut what about other communities from mother to village officer
  who just using computer for their daily activity. They just using computer
  without knowing about OS in their computer\, without knowing about GNOME\,
  about GNU/Linux\, or FOSS.\n\nThis session will talk about this\, how our 
 community spread about GNOME to new people.

DESCRIPTION:With the success of connected cars\, there is an increasing dem
 and for a secure\, consumer-oriented infotainment platform. The open source
  application framework "Apertis" serves as embedded end-to-end solution in 
 the automotive environment. With many contributions to the GNOME technologi
 es over the years and its own Free software components\, Apertis is truly a
  unique product in the automotive world which pushes the boundaries of a tr
 aditionally closed source environment.\n\nSecurity is guaranteed by multipl
 e lines of defense\, including MAC (Mandatory Access Control) and xdg-app a
 s sandboxing mechanism. D-Bus provides a stable SDK-API to the app-develope
 r.

DESCRIPTION:"ZeMarmot" is a project of 2D animation movie\, to be released 
 under CC By-SA/Free Art licenses and fully made with creative Free Software
 . In particular\, it is currently fully digitally drawn on GIMP\, video-edi
 ted in Blender and sound-edited with Ardour.\nOur desktop of choice is GNOM
 E\, under a GNU/Linux operating system.\n\nWe will present the film project
  and its status\, what happened in the last year since we started the proje
 ct\, but also how we contribute back\, since Jehan\, scenarist of ZeMarmot\
 , has also been an active contributor of GIMP and other Free Software for s
 everal years.\n\nFinally we would like to raise the question: is GNOME read
 y for the creative artists? We may not have the full answer\, but a part of
  it!\n\n----\n\nZeMarmot's director\, Aryeom Han\, is a young South Korean 
 director of animation film\, whose first co-directed short animation got sc
 reened in several festivals and won 2 prices\, and later worked on corporat
 e videos and several projects. Together with Jehan\, they also won a "Firef
 ox Flicks" price in 2012\, in "New Technology" category\, for an animation 
 augmented through HTML5.\n\nAbout ZeMarmot: http://film.zemarmot.net/\nBlog

DESCRIPTION:The roots of the Internet can be found in the move from large m
 ainframes to smaller and locally connected machines (Unices or VAXen) Unix.
  Obviously there was a need to connect to remote machines in a convenient w
 ay and not only with manually managed uucp networks.\n\nEventually in the m
 id 90ies decentralization was achieved and directly visible due to Gopher a
 nd the Web. With the move of the big search engines to a general service pr
 oviders\, things started to revert to the former centralization.\n\nThe Int
 ernet still looks like a collection of many computers but in reality most s
 ystem do not anymore work without access to\, say\, apis.google.com. Unfort
 unately desktops environments moved in the same direction.\nDo we really wa
 nt to rely on other peoples machines?

DESCRIPTION:The traditional model of a GNOME desktop is tightly tied to the
  traditional model of a Linux distribution: many packages that are individu
 ally installed onto the users system\; some are low-level system services\,
  some are core desktop components\, and some are applications. While in som
 e ways very\nflexible\, this model is also fragile: the continuing correct 
 operation of the system depends on a complex dance of installation and upgr
 ades of thousands\nof packages. Systems based on free software components\,
  from OLPC\, to ChromeOS\, to Android have moved away from this model\, but
  are no longer recognizable as a Linux distribution.\n\nUpcoming releases o
 f Fedora Workstation will offer an alternate installation method where the 
 operating system is distributed as an ostree image and atomically upgraded 
 as a whole\, while applications are installed on top as xdg-app bundles. Th
 e intent is to provide an experience that is much more\nrobust than the tra
 ditional package-based installation\, while providing additional flexibilit
 y in installing applications. Applications will no\nlonger be strictly boun
 d to the Fedora package set\, making it easy for third parties to provide a
 pplications that work across multiple distributions and distribution versio
 ns. The talk will go over the underlying technologies and discuss how they 
 interact with a traditional distribution ecosystem\, and with\nthe evolving
  ecosystem of xdg-app. There will also be discussion of how users\, such as
  developers\, need to work differently on such a system\, and how we can be
 st enable that.
